2) For offline file reading

        ./monitor -r
        < then you type the name of the file and press Enter>



------------Retransmissions---------------------
Answers:
9) Can you tell if an incoming TCP packet is a retransmission? If yes, how? If not, why?

    TCP packets contain information about the sequence number and acknowledgement number. By using
    those numbers, there is an interaction between the sender and the receiver. On my code, I tried to 
    implement the functionality of marking a packet as retransmitted, by creating the following three 
    functions: check_retransmission(), add_transmission(), add_to_current_flow(). The idea is, that we should 
    check if the sequence number, acknowledgement number etc are all in order on the same network flow.
    However, that didn't work well, because more packets are marked as retransmitted as expected,
    by cross-checking with Wireshark.

10) Can you tell if an incoming UDP packet is a retransmission? If yes, how? If not, why? 
 
    We cannot tell if a UDP packet is retransmitted, because this protocol does not support this functionality 
    and all the information needed.
