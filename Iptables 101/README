Adblocker implemented according to the assignment. I tested my adblocker with two ways:
When adblocker is on:

    1) I tried to load some of the websites on the "blacklist", but they couldn't load.

    2) I clicked on some websites that contain ads, but the ads didn't appear.

However, there are some persistent ads, that the adblocker couldn't block.
This happens because some websites contain adblocker detectors, which eventually bypass 
my adblocker, or the rules that must be configured are more complicated and specialised
than the ones we applied.
