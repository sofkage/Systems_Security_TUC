   TASK A
Using  EVP_BytesToKey() to derive the key by digest SHA1

   TASK B
Encrypts plaintext using the key from tast A. AES_ECB mode defined on top.
Stores output to ciphertext.

   TASK C
Decrypts ciphertext. Stores output to plaintext.

   TASK D
 This function reads the data from an input file and encrypts them using the
 encryption function (Task B), using the key generated by the KDF (Task A), and
 then generates the CMAC. After the ciphertext and the CMAC are
 generated, it stores the ciphertext concatenated with the CMAC in an appropriate output file.
 Cmac is generated by gen_cmac.

   TASK E
 Separates the ciphertext from the CMAC and decrypts the ciphertext.
 Using the plaintext obtained by the decryption, it
 generates its CMAC and compares it to the one that came with the ciphertext,
 with the function The function memcmp.
 Makes  verify = 1 (TRUE) if the CMAC is successfully verified and stores the plaintext
 in an appropriate file. Otherwise, it just returns FALSE ( verify = 0).

   TASK F
  When needed, the password used is TUC2016030136.
  All the operations are implemented and the files are generated.
  For step 4, non of the files are verified. Thus, no txt file is generated
  and the function only prints " Not Verified - FALSE ".
